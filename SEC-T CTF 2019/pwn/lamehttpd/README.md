Challenge Description:<br>
The 'Droidcoinstealer'-crew seems to be using hacked routers as their command-and-control servers. Luckily, we were able to recover a sample of their custom httpd service
PWN their command-and-control server and recover all of those stolen Droidcoins!
Local players can turn in this flag at the ACNR-booth for swag and streetcred!
