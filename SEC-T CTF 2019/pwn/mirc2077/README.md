Challenge Description:<br>
One of the rogue androids are hanging out in his private IRC, dealing warez and 0-days. He takes his OPSEC seriously and is behind 9000 proxies. An agent of ours managed to add a backdoor to the repository of his favourite IRC-client. Unfortunately we are scraping up whats left of him from a burning barrel.
We recovered this USB-stick, use whatever is on it to pwn and reveal the androids real IP-address. We'll do the rest ;)
